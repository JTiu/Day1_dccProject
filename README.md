Simple Console App: Addition of Variables
The purpose of this worksheet is to focus down, step by step, on the problem-solving process.
I learned to outline the process for breaking down problems into their most simple elements.
I created a console app (.NET framework) in Visual Studio Community 2019. 
I wrote the code inside the Static void Main.  I learned the purpose of the curly braces.
I declared an integer called “Value1” with the value of “7”.
I found the correct data type to divide “Value1” variable by two.
I learned the Console.ReadLine method to capture input of another variable.
I learned how to print to the console ("Hello World!")
